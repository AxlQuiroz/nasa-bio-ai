Methods
Gold chloride, citric acid, sodium borohydride, 
HNP1(ACYCRIPACIAGERRYGTCIYQGRLW
AFCC) 
and 
LL-37 
(LLGDFFRKSKEKRIVQRIKDFLRNLVPRTES
) peptides, and other chemicals were purchased 
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). We 
purchased the HEK293T cell line and HEK293T 
cell line from the American Type Culture 
Collection, which were grown according to an 
ATCC procedure. The GFP tagged Baculovirus 
pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant 
(B.1.617.2) spike protein (#C1123G, Montano 
Molecular, Bozeman, MT) was purchased from 
Montan0 Molecular, Bozeman, Montana 59715.
Synthesis of Graphene Oxide: Graphene oxide 
nanoparticles were synthesized using natural 
Graphite powder with an average size of <150 
μm using according to modified Hummer’s 
method which was also described in our previous 
work 22-23, as shown in Figure S1. In brief, .501 g 
of graphite, 0.503 g of sodium nitrate, and 23 mL 
of concentrated sulfuric acid were added into a 
500 ml beaker and kept under ice bath (below 
5°C) with constant stirring. The mixture was 
stirred for 20 minutes and then 3.0 gm of 
potassium permanganate was added to the 
mixture. The next batch of permanganate was 
added after the green color disappeared. Then the 
mixture was maintained under stirring at the 
same condition. 3 mL of concentrated sulfuric 
acid was used to wash down the graphite on the 
inside of the beaker after each addition. Then 75 
ml of deionized water was further added to the 
above solution. Next the H2O2 (50 %) was added 
to the mixture till there was no gas generated (~ 3 
mL). There was a distinct change in color was 
observed from dark brown to golden yellow 
which is the visual marker for the formation of 
graphene oxide. color. Then, the yellow mixture 
was washed with 5% HCl followed by ethanol 
for remove the metal impurities. Finally, the GO 
was purified by centrifugation at 10000 rpm 
speed for 60 min repeatedly until the pH was near 
neutral (pH ~ 6.5-7.0).

graphene quantum dots (GQDs) from graphite

The GO was finally dried by lyophilization at -
20oC and characterized by spectroscopic and 
imaging analysis.  
Synthesis 
of 
Graphene 
Quantum 
Dots 
(GQDs): Graphene Quantum Dots (GQDs) also 
synthesized 
using 
our 
previously 
reported 
procedure developed by our group22-23, as shown 
in Figure S1. In a typical synthesis, 100 mg of 
GO was added in 100 ml of Dimethyl formamide 
S3
(DMF) to produce GO-DMF suspension. Then 
the suspension was transferred into a Teflon lined 
autoclave, and it was heated 200oC for overnight. 
Then the mixture was cooled down to room 
temperature and filtered using 0.5-micron filter 
paper to remove black precipitate. Lastly, the 
solid product was obtained by rotary evaporation 
under reduced pressure at 80oC. 
Synthesis of HNP-1 and LL-37 Human Host 
Defense Peptide attached Graphene Quantum 
Dots (GQDs):  For the development of HNP-1, 
and LL-37 human host defense peptide attached 
GQDS, we have used carbodiimide coupling 
chemistry between carboxy group of graphene 
oxides and amine group of peptides 17,23.

As shown in Figure 1, for this purpose, initially, 
carboxyl groups from GQDs were activated using 
1-ethyl-3(3-(dimethylamino)-
propyl)carbodiimide·HCl 
(EDC) 
and N-
hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) coupling agents for 
30 min17-23. In the next step, HNP-1, and LL-37 
human host defense peptides, were added at 
different weight ratios under stirring for 24 h. 
After that, we have performed centrifugation at 
10 000 rpm for 30 min, followed by decantation. 
At the end high-resolution transmission electron 
microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) 
spectroscopy, Nano ZS, Energy-dispersive X-ray 
(EDX), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) 
spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy have been 
used for characterization14,15,17,22-23, as shown in 
Figure S2.

 For the binding between, SARS-CoV-2 Delta 
Variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein RBD and HNP-
1, and LL-37 human host defense peptides 
attached GQDs, we have used binding buffer 
(PBS, pH =7.4, including 136.8 mM NaCl, 10.1 
mM Na2HPO4, 2.7 mM KCl, 1.8 mM KH2PO4, 
0.55 mM MgCl2).

For the detection of luminescence from HNP-1, 
and LL-37 human host defense peptides attached 
GQDs, in the presence and absence SARS-CoV-2 
Delta Variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein RBD, we 
have used portable fluorescence spectrometer 
developed by us with laser excitation of 360 nm 
diode laser 14-15,22-23. In our design, we have used 
solid state high stability DPSS laser with 
adjustable power of up to 50 mW laser power. 
InPhotonics fiber optic probe has been used for 
excitation and data collection14-15,22-23. For 
emission signal collections, we have used 
miniaturized QE65000 spectrometer from Ocean 
Optics14-15,22-23. 
All 
measurements 
were 
performed with 5 ms integration time with 5 
spectra averaging using the software14-15,22-23.
ELISA like assay for determining the binding 
between Delta Variant (B.1.617.2) spike 
protein peptides attached GQDs
For this purpose, we have used ELISA-like assay 
using His-tag Delta variant SARS-CoV-2 S1 
protein, which were adsorbed to a 96-well plate 
overnight at 4 °C. 
After that the plate was blocked using blocking 
buffer and then different concentration peptide 
attached GQDs were incubated on the plate. In 
the next step, we have used streptavidin protein 
that is covalently conjugated to horseradish 
peroxidase (HRP) enzyme for determine the 
binding. We have also used TMB (3,3',5,5'-
tetramethylbenzidine) for colorimetric assay 
detection. Signal intensity was recorded using 
plate reader. From the binding curve, we have 
estimated the binding constants (KD) using non-
linear curve fitting as reported before.
In Vitro experiment for blocking ACE2 
binding with Baculovirus pseudotyped with a 
SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant (B.1.617.2) spike 
protein    using Fluorescence Imaging:
For this experiment we have used human 
embryonic kidney-239T cells with a high 
expression of ACE2 (HEK-293T). Since Delta 
variant SARS-CoV-2 is a biosafety-level-3 virus, 
for our experiment we have used GFP tagged 
Baculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 
Delta Variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein (catalog 
number 
#C1123G). 
For 
this 
experiment, 
HEK293T cells were plated on a 96-well plate in 
complete media (DMEM + 10% FBS) and 
incubated under normal growth conditions (5% 
CO2 and 37°C, protected from light) for 12-24 
hours14-15,27-28. The pseudovirus stock (2.5 µl of 
the 2X1010 units/ml stock) was mixed with the 
HNP-1, and LL-37 human host defense peptides 
attached GQDs at different concentration and 
incubated for 1 h at 37°C, then laid over 
HEK293T cells plated in the 96-well tissue 
culture dishes, along with 0.6 μL of the 500 
nM sodium butyrate. Plates were incubated at 
37°C and 5% CO2 for one day14-15,27-28. Cells 
were 
fixed 
in 
3.7% 
formaldehyde 
for 
fluorescence imaging experiment14-15,27-28. For the 
fluorescence imaging of an Olympus IX71 
inverted confocal fluorescence microscope fitted 
with a SPOT Insight digital camera was used14-
15,27-28.
Virus inhibition for HNP-1, and LL-37 human 
host defense peptides attached GQDs
HEK293T cells (ATCC # CRL3216) were plated 
on a 96-well plate in complete media (DMEM + 
S6
10% FBS) and incubated under normal growth 
conditions (5% CO2 and 37°C, protected from 
light) for 12-24 hours14-15,27-28. These HEK293T 
cells express low levels of ACE2 receptor that is 
sufficient 
for 
delta 
variant 
SARS-CoV-2 
entry. Dilutions of test HNP-1, and LL-37 human 
host defense peptides attached GQDs were made 
in DMEM with an end volume of 100 µl each14-
15,27-28. The GFP tagged Baculovirus pseudotyped 
with a SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant (B.1.617.2) 
spike protein stock (2.5 µl of the 2X1010 units/ml 
stock) was mixed with the HNP-1, and LL-37 
human host defense peptides attached GQDs at 
different concentrations and incubated for 1 h at 
37°C, then laid over HEK293T cells plated in the 
96-well tissue culture dishes, along with 0.6 
μL of the 500 nM sodium butyrate (to give a final 
concentration of 2mM) 14-15,27-28. Plates were 
incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 48 h. Cells 
were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde and the assay 
was read on Cytation 5 automated fluorescent 
microscope (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, 
VT, USA) 14-15,27-28. The total number of cells per 
well were counted and data was analyzed in 
Prism 8 (Graphpad Inc) 27-28. Triplicate samples 
were used and standard error of mean was plotted 
as error bars14-15,27-28.
Finding the concentration of virus
To find out the concentration of virus, HEK293T 
cells were plated in 12 well tissue culture dishes 
and then the cells were infected with the virus 
with a dilution range of 102 to 107, as we have 
reported before 14-15,27-28.  After that, the virus 
titers were calculated by counting the GFP 
positive cells, as we have reported before14-15,27-
28.
